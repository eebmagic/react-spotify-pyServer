# react-spotify-pyServer

This is a template for a simple react app that can get a user's spotify auth (in `react-sample/`).

Can also make calls to a python server, which is demonstrated in `server.py`.

## Running
1. Start the python server `python server.py`
2. In another terminal window enter the react dir: `cd react-sample`
3. Install deps: `npm i`
4. Startup: `npm start`
